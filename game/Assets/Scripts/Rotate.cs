//This script is typically used in a game where you want an object to rotate continuously. The Update method is called once per frame and rotates the object this script is attached to around the z-axis at a rate of 360 * speed degrees per second. Time.deltaTime is used to make the rotation smooth and frame rate independent. The speed variable can be set in the Unity editor thanks to the [SerializeField] attribute. If you attach this script to an object in your Unity game, that object will rotate around its z-axis continuously. user Comment each line of this: using System.Collections; using System.Collections.Generic; using UnityEngine;
