/* This script is a basic template for a Unity script. It doesnâ€™t do anything yet (besides start the game) because the Start method is empty. 
You would add your own code inside Start to initialize any variables or set up any game objects when the game starts. 
The Gameplay class inherits from MonoBehaviour, which is the base class every script you create in Unity inherits from. 
It provides life-cycle functions such as Start(). */
